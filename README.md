# Happiness-index-Analysis

Introduction :
Through this project, we aim to find the correlation between the advent of COVID-19 and its impacts on the overall happiness of the general public in the world as a whole. <p>
With mental health issues becoming more and more of a concern, especially in today’s youth, scenarios like the pandemic can have major ramifications on the overall mental well-being of people, and through performing analysis on the dataset, we aim to find significant and glaring trends, and hope to make helpful inferences, which can find application in the real world.<p>
Questions of Interest:<p>
How much of a direct impact in the happiness index was seen for regions most severely affected by COVID-19?<p>
 Do third-world countries see more variance in their happiness index when comparing pre and post COVID-19 indices?<p>
What external factors indirectly amplify or alleviate the negative effects of COVID-19, if any?<p>
Are there any commonalities regarding positive trends in happiness that can be observed in the countries that had prompt vaccination movements?<p>
Is there anything that we can infer from this analysis that can help authorities and individuals be better prepared and equipped to preserve the mental well-being and happiness of, in any similar future occurrence?<p>
Which countries were the first ones to adopt effective vaccination measures to combat the spread of COVID-19?<p>
For which countries was the extent of COVID-19 and vaccination measures a mismatch, i.e., high cases but lack of vaccination measures. <p>


Dataset Description:<p>
Covid-19 has shattered daily lives of humanity across the globe. People have fallen into deep depression due to the effects it has created. The world had almost lost its happiness all along the way. Let us gather some data of Covid-19 and its impact on people and the societies. <p>

We gather the data across several countries on the covid tests, vaccinations, positive rates, deaths and information about people's health on various parameters like cardiovascular, diabetes, smoking. Additionally, there are attributes based on the hospitality service like hospital beds per thousand people, along with population indices. The vaccination data is gathered from Governments and Health Ministries. The population metrics are retrieved from the United Nations. All this data in a dataset is collected from Kaggle, a repository of data sets.<p>

Now that we have gathered data on Covid vaccination and people, we can analyze the happiness index, on how it has changed through the years 2015-2022 and how it has been affected by covid. In order to achieve this, we have gathered a dataset on “World Happiness Report” from Kaggle. The columns assess the degree to which each of six attributes – financial generation, social back, life anticipation, flexibility, nonattendance of debasement, and liberality contribute to making life assessments higher in each nation. The data is across 153 countries and the factors adding a value to the scores.<p>

We have the .csv files of the data set provided by the Kaggle website. The dataset being available from a legitimate source helps us to analyze real time covid impact.
